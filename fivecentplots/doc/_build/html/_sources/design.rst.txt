Elements
--------
Each item in a plot (axis, labels, legend, etc.) consists of an ``Element`` object.
This class stores all the attributes like color, size, style, and position, that define how
the object should be rendered in the plot.

The figure below illustrates some of the possible ``Element`` objects that are defined
in **fivecentplots**.
